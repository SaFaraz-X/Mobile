Week 4 Project:

Create a small React Native Expo app that tells jokes. When you first see the screen, the setup to a joke is displayed (i.e "Why
did the chicken cross the road?"). Below the setup is a button--when the button is pressed the setup disappears and the punchline to the
joke displays ("To get to the other side")
