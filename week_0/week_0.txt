Week 0 Project:

Part 1:
    Think of an mobile application that could be useful / could solve a problem for a new college student at UVA.  The goal of this exercise is to start thinking about the things that need to go into an app.
    Create a very rough wireframe of what the app interface would look like: you can either sketch this on paper or use a wireframe website (I recommend Marvel).
    It doesn't have to be super detailed, just enough to give an idea of how a user would interface with the app. After you have a 
    rough sketch, think of what tools you would need to build your application, and prepare a brief presentation on your idea in Google Slides. Here are some things to think about:

    1. What is the purpose of the website?
    2. Do I need to grab data from anywhere?
    3. Where would I want to store data?
    4. Do I want to focus on either Android or iOS users?
    5. Specific programming language(s) to use? (don't worry if you don't know any for this one)
    6. Would I want users to sign in, and how would I handle user authentication?

    The list above is just some things to think about-- you don't necessarily need to include every one, and are not limited to the list.
    Obviously, some of these topics you may not know a lot about, as we have only had about an hour of class time! Not to worry, we just
    want to see that you have given a couple topics some thought (google is certainly your friend here!)

What to submit:
